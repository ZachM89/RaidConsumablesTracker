# RaidConsumablesTracker
An excel spreadsheet that utilizes the Advanced Trade Skill Window addon for Vanilla World of Warcraft to keep track of your desired raid consumables and the materials required to craft them. 

# Why would I use this?
The whole reason I made this spreadsheet was because I store my herbs and other materials for raid consumables on alts so I can save space on my main. This spreadsheet allows you to see what materials you already have on your alts without logging in to them to check, it tells you exactly how many you need to send to your character with alchemy to make your consumables, and tells you how many of each material you may need to purchase/acquire to make the desired amount of consumable.

It essentially eliminates any guess-work about how many of each material you need to acquire or send over from your alt to your character with alchemy.

# Features
- Allows you to enter the amount of each consumable you desire.
- Automatically populates an inventory of all of your consumables and materials to create consumables by pressing one button.
- Enter up to 3 raid instances to track consumables for.
